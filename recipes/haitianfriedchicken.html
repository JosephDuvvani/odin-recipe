    <h2>Make Quick Fried Chicken At Home</h2>

    <p>This Haitian fried chicken recipe varies from American-style fried chicken but is just as good. If you are in a hurry, you can marinate the chicken for 30 minutes, but the longer you leave it, the better. You may sprinkle freshly squeezed lemon juice on top if you like.</p>
